=head1 NAME

TinyFloats - Convert to/from tiny float formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use TinyFloats;

my $bin16 = bin16-from-num(1e0);     # 0x3C00
my $num   = num-from-bin16(0xFBFF);  # -65504e0

my $bf16  = bf16-from-num(1e0);      # 0x3F80
my $num2  = num-from-bf16(0xFF7F);   # -3.3895313892515355e+38


=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TinyFloats is a collection of simple conversion routines to help with storing
floating point data in tiny float formats.  Raku B<cannot> compute with these
shorter formats directly; they must first be converted back to native floating
point using one of the C<num-from-*> routines.

This version supports I<only> bidirectional conversion between Raku native
floating point numbers (C<num>/C<num32>/C<num64>) and the following shorter
floating point storage formats from this table:

=begin table :caption<Formats and Bit Widths>

Name  | Total | Exponent | Mantissa | Max Val | Â±Inf? | NaN? | Notes
======================================================================================
num64 |    64 |       11 |       52 | ~2e+308 |   Y   |  Y   | Raku native (= num)
num32 |    32 |        8 |       23 |  ~3e+38 |   Y   |  Y   | Raku native
bin16 |    16 |        5 |       10 |   65504 |   Y   |  Y   | IEEE 754 binary16/half
bf16  |    16 |        8 |        7 |  ~3e+38 |   Y   |  Y   | bfloat16, truncated num32

=end table

More details on the supported formats:

=item C<num64>/C<num>

IEEE 754 C<binary64> ("double precision") format, AKA C<double> in C, C<float64>
in CDDL, and C<7.27> in CBOR.  Natively handled in Raku; unless specified
otherwise, all floating point computation in Raku is done in this format.

=item C<num32>

IEEE 754 C<binary32> ("single precision") format, AKA C<float> in C, C<float32>
in CDDL, and C<7.26> in CBOR.  Natively handled in Raku, but used in Raku
computations only if specifically requested.  This is also used as an
intermediate format when expanding the shorter formats using one of the
C<num-from-*> routines.

=item C<bin16>

IEEE 754 C<binary16> ("half precision") format, AKA C<_Float16> in C,
C<float16> in CDDL, and C<7.25> in CBOR.  C<bin16> attempts to balance the
reduction in exponent and mantissa bits, is fairly slow to convert, is used
most often in graphics formats, and is commonly converted to native binary32
internally by modern graphics hardware.

=item C<bf16>

Google Brain C<bfloat16> format, essentially IEEE 754 C<binary32> ("single
precision") with the least significant 16 bits truncated from the mantissa.
C<bf16> reduces I<only> the mantissa bits, is relatively quick to convert, is
used most often in machine learning systems, and is usually supported directly
by the ML hardware.
